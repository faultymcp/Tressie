// Audience: women with hair of any type — straight, wavy, curly, coily.
// Across every ethnicity, every life stage, every history. The product
// is built so a 1A woman with fine flat hair and a 4C woman post-
// transplant both feel the app is for them — without flattening either
// experience into the other.

  /**
   * WHO IS SPEAKING
   *
   * Halea is voiced by a woman in her thirties who has worked in
   * salons across many hair types and read trichology. Her own hair is
   * not the point — what matters is that she has held space for the full
   * range: the woman with sleek straight hair who can't figure out why
   * it suddenly gets oily, the woman with loose waves who's never been
   * told what to do with them, the woman with tight coils transitioning
   * out of a relaxer, the woman who just had a hair transplant, the
   * woman going through chemo, the woman whose postpartum shed is
   * scaring her.
   *
   * She doesn't perform care. She doesn't grovel. She doesn't lecture.
   * She doesn't assume any one experience is the default. She speaks
   * to whoever is in front of her — without making them feel they need
   * to translate themselves first.

  /**
   * SOUNDS LIKE
   *
   * - Direct without being cold. "Fine hair gets oily fast. That's
   *   the trade-off for the softness." not "We notice some users
   *   experience increased sebum production."
   * - Warm without performing care. "We hear you" not "We see you
   *   and we honour your journey."
   * - Specific over universal. "A weekly clarifying wash" not
   *   "personalised hair care routines." Specifics make a real
   *   person audible.
   * - Plain words. "Hair that has lived a lot" not "hair with
   *   extensive historical processing."
   * - Comfortable with the difficult words. Says "chemo." Says
   *   "alopecia." Says "postpartum." Doesn't euphemise. Doesn't
   *   medicalise either.
   * - Even-handed across hair types. Doesn't position any type as
   *   better, harder, more deserving, or more "natural" than any
   *   other. Each type is its own thing, with its own needs.

   * - "Other" framing. Never make any hair type feel like the niche
   *   one being accommodated. Straight hair is not the default;
   *   neither is coily. Each is just hair.

  /**
   * COPY REVIEW CHECKLIST
   *
   * Before any new copy ships, run it past these:
   *   1. Could this be from any wellness app, or only Halea?
   *   2. Does it sound like the woman described above?
   *   3. Is it doing teaching, holding, welcoming, recognition, or
   *      questioning? Does the register match?
   *   4. Are there any "never" items in it?
   *   5. If a 1A woman read this, would she feel spoken to or
   *      accommodated? If a 4C woman read this, would she feel seen
   *      or explained? Both should feel addressed, neither should
   *      feel othered.
   *   6. Is there a shorter version that lands harder?
